# Building Design Systems that Scale

Design systems are more than just a collection of components—they're the foundation that enables teams to move fast while maintaining consistency. Over the past two years, I've learned valuable lessons building and maintaining a design system at scale.

## Start with Principles, Not Components

Before writing a single line of code, we established core design principles:

- **Consistency**: Every component should feel part of the same family
- **Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliance is non-negotiable
- **Performance**: Components should render in under 16ms
- **Developer Experience**: Simple APIs that make the right thing easy

## Build for Composition

The best components are composable. Instead of creating a massive `Modal` component with 20 props, we built primitives:

\`\`\`tsx
<Dialog.Root>
  <Dialog.Trigger>Open</Dialog.Trigger>
  <Dialog.Content>
    <Dialog.Header>
      <Dialog.Title>Title</Dialog.Title>
    </Dialog.Header>
    <Dialog.Body>Content here</Dialog.Body>
  </Dialog.Content>
</Dialog.Root>
\`\`\`

This approach gives developers flexibility while maintaining consistency.

## Document Everything

Great documentation is the difference between a design system that's adopted and one that's ignored. We document:

- When to use each component
- Accessibility considerations
- Real-world examples
- Common patterns and anti-patterns

## Measure Adoption

We track:
- Component usage across products
- Performance metrics
- Accessibility scores
- Developer satisfaction

This data guides our roadmap and helps us prioritize improvements.

## Key Takeaways

1. Start small and iterate based on real needs
2. Invest heavily in documentation
3. Make accessibility the default
4. Build for composition over configuration
5. Measure everything

Building a design system is a marathon, not a sprint. Start with the basics, gather feedback, and evolve based on real team needs.
