# The Art of Micro-interactions

Micro-interactions are the small, subtle animations that guide users through an interface. When done right, they're invisible. When done wrong, they're annoying. Here's what I've learned about crafting delightful micro-interactions.

## Less is More

The best micro-interactions are barely noticeable. They should feel natural, not flashy. A button that gently scales on hover, a smooth transition between states—these small details add up to create a polished experience.

## Timing Matters

Animation timing can make or break an interaction:

\`\`\`tsx
// Too fast (feels jarring)
transition={{ duration: 0.1 }}

// Just right
transition={{ duration: 0.2, ease: "easeOut" }}

// Too slow (feels sluggish)
transition={{ duration: 0.8 }}
\`\`\`

For most interactions, 200-300ms feels natural.

## Provide Feedback

Every user action should have a response. Clicked a button? Show a subtle press effect. Hovering over a link? Change the color. Submitting a form? Show a loading state.

\`\`\`tsx
<motion.button
  whileHover={{ scale: 1.02 }}
  whileTap={{ scale: 0.98 }}
  transition={{ duration: 0.2 }}
>
  Click me
</motion.button>
\`\`\`

## Respect Reduced Motion

Always respect users' motion preferences:

\`\`\`tsx
const prefersReducedMotion = window.matchMedia(
  '(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)'
).matches;

const transition = prefersReducedMotion 
  ? { duration: 0 }
  : { duration: 0.3 };
\`\`\`

## Common Patterns

### Page Transitions
Fade content in when it enters the viewport:

\`\`\`tsx
<motion.div
  initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 20 }}
  animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
  transition={{ duration: 0.5 }}
>
  Content
</motion.div>
\`\`\`

### Hover Effects
Subtle scale and shadow changes:

\`\`\`tsx
<motion.div
  whileHover={{ 
    scale: 1.05, 
    boxShadow: "0 4px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)" 
  }}
>
  Card
</motion.div>
\`\`\`

### Loading States
Use skeleton screens instead of spinners when possible. They feel faster.

## Testing Interactions

1. Use them yourself for a week
2. Watch real users interact with them
3. A/B test when possible
4. Measure completion rates

Remember: The goal of micro-interactions is to guide and delight users, not to show off your animation skills.
